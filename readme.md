# Squishy Scroll 🐨
## Never leave a picture behind again 🥲

Squishy Scroll is a simple piece of JavaScript that squizes images in a horizontal flexbox gallery as they leave the viewport. 

The structure is simple: 
- Squize the image and let the frame leave the vieport. 
- Calculate the distance of the left side of the frame to the left side of the viewport and retract that from the width of the image inside the frame. 

In this way it's possible to scroll back and forth, even though the image dosent take up any space. 

💡 This effect can easily be applyed to vertical scroll as well.
